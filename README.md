# BoomBikes-BikeSharing
> BoomBikes is a shared bikes application used in USA. This project contains linear regression model to predict demand for shared bikes bookings using BookBikes app. During COVID-19 lockdown the company  is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information
- Implementation of linear regression model to predict demand for booking count.
- The data collected from 2018 and 2019 year bookings.
- We want to comup with model with demand prediction to increase shared bike bookings once the quarantine situation ends.
- This dataset contains general information of weather situations, day wise booking information.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 We are able to achieve 81% R2-Score.
- Conclusion 2 Linear regression model is robust with low complexity.
- Conclusion 3 Key factors for shared bike bookings are ambiance temperature, weather situations, holidays.
- Conclusion 4 Model has perfect fit on both training and test data with approximatly 81% R2-score.
